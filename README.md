# archman

`archman` is a simple shell script that fetches pages from [Arch Linux's man
page site](https://man.archlinux.org) and displays them to you.

## Installation

It's not yet on the AUR, but will hopefully be one day.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Insert-Creative-Name-Here/archman.git
$ cd archman
```

And there should be the 'archman' file. If you want to be able to invoke it at
any time, move it to a directory that is on $PATH
